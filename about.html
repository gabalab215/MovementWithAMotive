    <h2>About Movement With A Motive</h2>
  
    <div class="about-section">
      <p>
        Movement With A Motive is a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering individuals and communities through creative expression and movement. 
        We believe in using dance, art, and education as tools for healing, growth, and social impact.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Our mission is to inspire positive change by offering accessible classes, workshops, and events that connect people, uplift voices, and spark transformation. 
        Whether through movement or messaging, everything we do is rooted in purpose and powered by passion.
      </p>
  
      <h3>About the Founder</h3>
      <p>
        I'm Gabriella Hennessey—most people call me Gabby. I’ve been dancing for 16 years and was inspired by my Cuban heritage and lifelong love for movement to start Movement With A Motive. 
        At 17 years old and currently a student at Westwood High, I’ve combined my passions for dance, graphic design, and coding to create something that gives back to the Latin American community. 
        This nonprofit is more than a project—it’s a purpose.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Supporting LULAC</h3>
      <p>
        As part of our mission, we support the 
        <strong><a href="https://lulac.org/" target="_blank">League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC)</a></strong>—
        the oldest and most widely respected Hispanic civil rights organization in the United States.
        LULAC works to advance the economic condition, educational attainment, political influence, housing, health, and civil rights of Hispanic Americans through community-based programs.
      </p>
        In addition to providing community support, positive messaging, and accessible dance classes and programming, a portion of the donations raised through Movement with a Motive will be donated to LULAC to further their important efforts.
